An update for Neopolitan by Danaquisition. 
*Note - I am not the original person who made these Neo emotes. I simply edited them so they won't look jarring anymore.




LIST OF THINGS FIXED 

-Removed the (a), (b), and anim folders because they're practically useless.
-Renamed most emotes to (a)/(b) to compensate for killing the useless folders.
-Cropped her emotes so they fit properly in AO. She will no longer look tiny as hell.
-Intro1Full -> Intro
-Adjusted "Back" so it's not just a boring still.
